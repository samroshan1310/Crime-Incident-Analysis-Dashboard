**Project Report: Hunting an APT with Splunk Workshop**

**Introduction:**

Welcome to the report on hunting an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) using Splunk Enterprise and Enterprise Security. This report documents the process of threat hunting based on the Boss of the SOC 2017 dataset, which was developed by Splunk's Security Specialist team. The objective of this workshop is to provide hands-on experience in identifying and mitigating APTs using Splunk's powerful analytics capabilities.

**Lab Environment and Dataset:
**
The dataset utilized in this workshop was generated in August 2017 by members of Splunk's Security Specialist team. The lab environment comprised Windows endpoints equipped with the Splunk Universal Forwarder and Splunk Stream. These forwarders were configured with best practices for Windows endpoint monitoring, including a comprehensive deployment of Microsoft Sysmon and optimal settings for Windows Event logging. Additionally, the environment featured a Palo Alto Networks next-generation firewall for traffic capture and web proxy services, along with Suricata for network-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS).
